      "Although we live in Georgia, Coastal Cabinets and Closets, Inc made our cabinet project for a property in Florida super easy! The positive reviews researched on Coastal Cabinets and Closets were absolutely right on. John Kraft was totally professional, detailed and honest. His pricing was very reasonable with good quality. He made us feel very comfortable by communicating with us at all times. We will definitely use Coastal Cabinets and Closets, Inc for any future jobs.",

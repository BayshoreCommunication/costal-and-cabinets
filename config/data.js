      "Although we live in Georgia, Kraft Built, Inc made our cabinet project for a property in Florida super easy! The positive reviews researched on Kraft Built were absolutely right on. John Kraft was totally professional, detailed and honest. His pricing was very reasonable with good quality. He made us feel very comfortable by communicating with us at all times. We will definitely use Kraft Built, Inc for any future jobs.",
